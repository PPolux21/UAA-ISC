# S05 - Programación Web

Teacher: Daniel Enrique Colunga Galván

During my fifth semester I took the subject named "*Programación Web*". I learned the basics about using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript when it comes to programming web applications.

These are the web applications I've made during the course.

The final project was completed in [this repository](https://github.com/PPolux21/50-Aniversario-Arq). It's about celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Architecture Degree at my university.
