# S03 - Estructuras de Datos

Teacher: Blanca Guadalupe Estrada Renter√≠a

During my third semester I took the subject named "*Estructuras de Datos*". I learned the basics about data structures using C++, such as: stacks and queues, linked lists (simple, double, and circular), graphs, trees. Finaly, I learned about the complexity of the algorithms.

These are the programs I've made during the course.
