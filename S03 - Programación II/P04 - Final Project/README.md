# P04 - Final Project â€” MinePac

This is the final project of the semester where I teamed up with [starcrash16](https://github.com/starcrash16) to complete the project. 

This project consists about making a game similar to [Pacman](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man), where the player is trapped into a maze and has to avoid enemies while eating collectibles spreaded over the maze. This game has to be made using C++ and [Allegro Graphics](https://github.com/liballeg/allegro_wiki). Therefore to try the game it Allegro has to be installed on the system.
