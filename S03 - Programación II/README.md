# S03 - Programación II

Teacher: José de Jesús Palos García

During my third semester I took the subject named "*Programación II*". I learned about Object-Oriented Programming using C++, and therefore learning the usage of the C++ standard library.

These are the programs I've made during the course. I also made a final project with [starcrash16](https://github.com/starcrash16), he has the main repository of the project, here you'll find the final version of the project.
