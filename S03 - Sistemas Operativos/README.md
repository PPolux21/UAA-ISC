# S03 - Sistemas Operativos

Teacher: Javier Santiago Córtes López

During my third semester I took the subject named "*Sistemas Operativos*". I learned the basics about the operating systems we use, same as the history of them and their evotution through the time.

I've only made one program during the course was a **Round Robin & Buddy System Simulator**.
