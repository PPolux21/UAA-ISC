# S04 - Lenguaje Ensamblador

Teacher: Juan Pedro Cisneros Santoyo

During my fourth semester I took the subject named "*Lenguaje Ensamblador*". I learned the basics about the Assembly Language for the Intel 8086. Therefore, I learned about records, aritmetic opperations (for the Assembly Language), logic operations (for the Assembly Language), Interruptions (21 & 10), file management, and ussing C++ with Assembly.

These are the programs I've made during the course.
