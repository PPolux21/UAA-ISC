# Final Project & Exam

Here are the files related to my Final Project & Exam.

For my Exam I've made a functional calculator (addition and substraction) that works with IEEE 754 for the storage of values with floating point. And, for the Final Project I've made a working piano with prerecorded songs, where the user can play the piano or listen to the songs that don't last more than 30 seconds.
