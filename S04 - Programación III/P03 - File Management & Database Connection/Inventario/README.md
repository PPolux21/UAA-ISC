# Final Project

This project consisted about making a CRUD with a data base connection, in this case we used SQLite for the data base, and also using a GUI thats is user freindly. We used Java Ant for the programming and compilation of the whole project. The main idea is for a business that is frequently updating their inventory.

This Project would not be done if it wasn't for my teammates:

- Luis Alberto Hernandez Velazco
- Brandon Ruiz Morales
