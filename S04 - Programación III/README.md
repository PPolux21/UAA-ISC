# S04 - Programación III

Teacher: Blanca Guadalupe Estrada Rentería

During my fourth semester I took the subject named "*Programación III*". I learned about ussing the programming language Java, where I used topics I already know such as: OOP, pointers, IO through console, file management, graphic usser interface, and database connection.

These are the programs I've made during the course.
