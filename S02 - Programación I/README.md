# S02 - Programación I

Teacher: Estela Lizbeth Muñoz Andrade

During my second semester I took the subject named "*Programación I*". I learned the necessary syntaxis needed to understand c++, while I was using recursion, pinters logic, then dynamic memory, and lastly file I/O.

For the course I used the IDE **Dev-C++** (programs made in C/C++). Here are all my *.cpp* files that I made during the course.
