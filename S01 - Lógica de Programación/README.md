# S01 - Lógica de Programación
Teacher: Estela Lizbeth Muñoz Andrade

During my first semester I took the subject named "*Lógica de Programación*". I learned the necessary logic for the creation of correctly structured programs. 

For the course I used the IDE **Dev-C++** (programs made in C) and **PSeInt** (programs made in pseudocode). Here are all my *.cpp* and *.psc* files that I made during the course.
